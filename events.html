                        <p id="paragraph_1"> Fantasy world is the best kept secret located in the heart of Kentucky.  Since the discovery of many new species of animals thought to be extinct, or never exist for that matter, a sort of theme park was designed.  This is more easily described as a cross between a theme park and a zoo.</p>
                <p class="about-header">Originally created to be a low-profile guarded habitat, it has changed directions after the population rebound of many of the plant and animal species.  Furthermore, the inhabitant population growth has meant the need for funding growth as well.   </p></div>
