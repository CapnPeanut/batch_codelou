                    <h3>History</h3>
                        <p id="paragraph_1"> Fantasy World has its roots back in the early 1900s when some teenagers stumbled upon a dragon lair in central Kentucky.  While most of those teenagers didn't make it, the dragon certainl did.  Eventually, several research expeditions were launched and several species were discovered hiding out away from human activity.</p>
                <p class="about-header">Through the years many people of many diferent educational backgrounds have studied and monitored the animals.  As they helped protect and nurse the numbers, they have increased substantially.  Today, the numbers are enough to let out the secret.  In fact, it's bcome such a task, they need help paying the bills. </p></div>
